# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical documents that are kept for context only.

Archived on: **2026-02-20**

Why archived:
- These docs referenced older architecture and flow assumptions (for example: `server/*` structure, RabbitMQ/Slack implementation, Azure-first AI path).
- The canonical source of truth now lives in:
  - [`../IMPLEMENTATION-AS-BUILT.md`](../IMPLEMENTATION-AS-BUILT.md)
  - [`../SETUP-GUIDE.md`](../SETUP-GUIDE.md)
  - [`../DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md`](../DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md)
  - [`../README.md`](../README.md)

Usage rule:
- Do not use archived docs for implementation decisions.
- Treat them as historical planning/reference material only.
